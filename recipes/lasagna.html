            Lasagna with sausage, mushroom, and lots of cheese is fast and easy on the stove top - and there's no compromise on flavor.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 pound hot italian sausage</li>
            <li>2 cups sliced mushroom</li>
            <li>1 jar Ragu Traditional sauce</li>
            <li>1 package lasagna sheets</li>
            <li>8 oz ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium high heat and add olive oil. Swirl to coat. Add the onion and saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the sausage and mushrooms; saute until meat is cooked through, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in the Ragu Traditional sauce, broken lasagna noodles and water. Cover and turn heat down to medium-low.</li>
            <li>Cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is al dente. Remove the lid and add the ricotta, 2/3 of the cheese; stir to combine. Top with remaining mozzarella and serve immediately.</li>
